# Flix-Pix
This is a movie database/rating platform created by my capstone team for our final project with Tech Elevator utilizing Java on the backend, PostgreSQL for the database, and Vue for the front end.
We utilized the OMDB api to create a movie app similar to letterboxd that gets called on the back end when a movie title is searched by an admin user who can then insert the movie into the Flix Pix database.
Once a movie is in the database, it will appear for all users on the platform and users have the ability to search, rate, and leave comments on movies they've watched.
Additionally, you can add friends and get recommended movies based on movie genres and directors that you have favorited films by.
