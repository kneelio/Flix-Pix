# Flix-Pix
This is a database created by my capstone team for our final project with Tech Elevator.
We utilized the OMDB api to create a movie app similar to letterboxd.
The app calls the OMDB api when searching a movie that the admin can then add to the Flix Pix database.
Once a movie is in the database, it will appear for all users on the platform and users have the ability to search, rate, and leave comments on movies they've watched.
Additionally, you can add friends and get recommended movies based on movie genres and directors that you have favorited films by.
